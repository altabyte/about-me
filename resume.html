            <p>
                Following my passion to educate I began teaching web technologies in Belfast&rsquo;s
                <a href="http://www.coderdojobelfast.com/" target="_blank">Coder Dojo</a>. Although I provide an introductory
                tutorial on <a href="http://www.altabyte.com/coderdojo/webdesign/" target="_blank">HTML &amp; CSS</a>,
                I encourage the kids to be creative and help them to produce their dream web sites.

                Co-founder of <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/SC264945/officers">Spiral Gateway</a>,
                a venture capital backed fabless semiconductor chip vendor deploying ultra-low-power high-performance solutions for the
                Digital Signal Processing (<abbr title="Digital Signal Processing">DSP</abbr>) market.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the lead software developer I was responsible for the system architecture and development of the
                company&rsquo;s Electronic Design Automation (<abbr title="Electronic Design Automation">EDA</abbr>) tool suite.
            </p>
            <p>
                Amalgamating the work of several PhD projects I built a prototype tool in <em>Java</em> and <em>C++</em>
                that could reduce high-level digital logic design times by an order of magnitude. This tool incorporated
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm" target="_blank">Evolutionary Algorithms</a>
                to dynamically generate digital circuits.

            <h1><span class="date">2001 - 2004</span> IP Shells</h1>
            <p>
                IP Shells was proof-of-concept project by The University of Edinburgh to develop a <strong>cloud platform</strong>,
                back in the days before <q>the cloud</q> was cool!
            </p>
            <p>
                Here I designed, developed and patented a prototype <abbr title="Enterprise Java">J2EE</abbr> solution allowing
                microchip manufacturers to design and test virtual digital circuits using the resources of a remote server farm.
                The server farm hosted both the <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> tool suites and the
                <abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr> Verilog/VHDL code libraries necessary to build and test
                advanced <abbr title="Digital Signal Processing">DSP</abbr> applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                A bespoke Java Swing <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> allowed <abbr title="System on Chip">SoC</abbr> designers to drag and drop
                high-level circuit blocks and perform integration tests, but the source code remained securely protected on the server.
                This novel approach enabled vendors, such as mobile phone manufactures, to validate the functionality of the
                circuit modules, whilst protecting the source code of these modules until a purchasing decision was made.
            </p>
            <p>
                This revolutionary <abbr title="Electronic Design Automation">EDA</abbr> deployment solution
                won the backing of a
                <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/innovation-get-details-about-innovate-uk-funding-competitions#smart" target="_blank">SMART</a>
                Award and a <a href="http://www.scotsman.com/business/companies/tech/chip-grant-for-ip-shells-1-1291152" target="_blank">£500,000 grant</a>
                from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

            <p>
                After graduating, I was offered a research position at
                <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/research/institutes/imns" title="Institute for Integrated Micro and Nano Systems">IMNS</a>
                in The University of Edinburgh. In this role I augmented an <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> application using
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)" target="_blank">heuristics</a> and
                <a href="http://uk.mathworks.com/discovery/genetic-algorithm.html">Genetic Algorithms</a> to enhance automated testing of
                <abbr title="Printed Circuit Boards">PCB</abbr>s using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C Programming Language">C</a>
                and <a href="https://common-lisp.net/" title="Common Lisp">Lisp</a>. The resulting work was
                <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=937972" title="Rule evolution in order based diagnostic systems" target="_blank">published</a>
