                Following my passion to educate I began teaching web technologies to kids in in Belfast&rsquo;s
                <a href="http://www.coderdojobelfast.com/" target="_blank">Coder Dojo</a>. Although I created an introductory
                <a href="http://altabyte.github.io/coder-dojo-web-design/" target="_blank">tutorial</a> on getting started with
                <a href="http://altabyte.github.io/coder-dojo-web-design/" target="_blank">HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript</a>,
                I encourage the kids to be creative and go off-script to build their own personalized web sites.
                They decide on the type of web site they want, then we sit together and make it happen.

                Currently I am the lead developer and system architect of the <a href="https://www.couplewise.com/" target="_blank">CoupleWise</a>
                relationship counseling solution. This is an e-learning platform that enables couples to work together
                to resolve their differences, with the ultimate goal of strengthening their relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to joining CoupleWise they had an ageing Rails 3 web site built around a MongoDB database.
                After careful evaluation I concluded that it would not be cost effective to upgrade their existing
                codebase and so redeveloped their entire platform from the ground up.
                This new platform utilizes <em>HTML5</em> technologies enabling better experience by users on mobile devices.
                Full responsive design ensures the application is equally accessible on a small iPhone 4 as it is on
                a large desktop web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using <em>PhoneGap</em> this application will soon be available in the Apple and Android app stores.
